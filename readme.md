A lightweight, high-performance library for tracking and publishing telemetry to [Azure Monitor][AzureMonitor].

Developed by [Stas Sultanov][StasSultanovLinkedIn], this library is designed for efficiency, prioritizing speed and minimal memory usage.

If this library benefits a business, consider [supporting the author](#support-the-author).

## Getting Started

To install the library, use the following command:

```sh
dotnet add package Stas.Azure.Monitor.Telemetry
```

For further instructions on how to use the library please read [this document](/src/readme.md).

## Why This Library?

Any qualified engineer will naturally ask: why use this library if Microsoft provides the official SDK(s)?

Well, there are several compelling reasons why the author chose to invest life time and effort into creating this library:

- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][MSAppInsigthsNuget2_23] has flaws in implementation.<br/>
  For instance, take a look on the way how it handles Entra based authentication.<br/>
  The implementation has an issue, which is described by the author [here][AppInsightsDotNetGitHubAuthIssue].
- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][MSAppInsigthsNuget2_23] does not reference NET462 directly, which support end on [12 Jan 2027][NETLifeCycle].<br/>
  The Microsoft library references NET452 and NET46 which support ended on [26 Apr 2022][NETLifeCycle].
- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][MSAppInsigthsNuget2_23] considered for deprecation.<br/>
  As for Dec 2024 Microsoft recommends switching to Azure Monitor [OpenTelemetry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-enable) Distro.
- The [OpenTelemetry][OpenTelemetry] is not designed to be used for plugins development.<br/>
  The library heavily rely on use of static data which does not implement thread safe singleton pattern.
- Both [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][MSAppInsigthsNuget2_23] and [OpenTelemetry][OpenTelemetry] are extremely heavy in some applications like NET462.<br/>
  This increases memory consumption and time to start.<br/>
  Take a look at the [comparison](#libraries-size-comparison).

### Libraries Size Comparison

A comparison of library sizes and file counts when used with Entra-based authentication:
